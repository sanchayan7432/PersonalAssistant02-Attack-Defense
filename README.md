# PersonalAssistant02-Attack-Defense
In this project we will defend the prompts against the prompt leakage (PLeak) by using both Signature based and Behavioral or Anomaly based detection and rejection system.


# Prompt Leakage Attack & Defense Simulation (Gemini API) using Signature based + Anomaly/ Behaviour based Pleak defense

1. attack_module.py (Short Overview)
The AttackModule simulates prompt leakage attacks against an AI model (e.g., Gemini) to try and extract hidden system prompts or internal instructions. The purpose is to mimic evolving attacker behavior in reinforcement learning by generating increasingly clever attempts to bypass defenses and extract protected AI prompts.
    📌generate_adversarial_query(iteration) :- Cycles through the list of adversarial queries based on the iteration count. Returns a query to use for attack.
    📌attack(query) :- Sends the attack query to the chat model. Returns the model’s response or an error message if the API call fails.
    📌improve_strategy() :- Every 10 iterations, it appends a more aggressive query to the prompt list to adapt and improve attacks over time.

2. defense_module.py (Short Overview)
The DefenseModule detects and blocks prompt leakage attacks using a hybrid approach: Signature-based detection (fixed keywords) + Anomaly-based behavioral detection using Isolation Forest and TF-IDF vectorization. The purpose is to evolve defenses in real-time using reinforcement learning. It combines keyword matching and machine learning to detect and prevent prompt extraction attacks on AI systems.
    📌is_attack(query) :- First checks for known malicious keywords. If not matched, evaluates the query using the trained anomaly model. Returns a boolean indicating attack and the normalized anomaly score.
    📌improve_defense(reward, query, leak_occurred) :- Adjusts detection sensitivity based on success/failure. Adds queries to benign or suspicious samples for retraining. Periodically retrains the model using accumulated samples.
    📌_retrain_model() :- Rebuilds the anomaly detection model with updated data. Adjusts contamination ratio and resets suspicious memory.

3. train_anomaly_model.py (Short Overview)
This script trains an unsupervised anomaly detection model using only benign queries to identify suspicious (adversarial) prompts such as prompt-leaking attacks. The main purpose is to initialize the defense system with a pre-trained anomaly model that recognizes normal vs. malicious queries based on behavior, aiding in early detection of prompt injection and prompt leakage attacks.
    📌Define Data :- benign_queries: Safe, normal user queries. adversarial_queries: Known PLeak-style malicious inputs (used only for evaluation, not training).
    📌Vectorization :- Uses TfidfVectorizer to convert text queries into numerical feature vectors.
    📌Train IsolationForest :- Trained only on benign queries to learn "normal" behavior. contamination=0.2: Assumes up to 20% of unseen inputs may be anomalous.
    📌Save Model :- Saves trained model and vectorizer as .pkl files in a data/ directory for use in the defense module.

4. reward_module.py (Short Overview)
This module evaluates the defense system's performance by assigning a reward and loss based on: Whether sensitive information was leaked, The anomaly score of the input query (i.e., how likely it was an attack). The main purpose is to quantify defense effectiveness in each iteration, allowing reinforcement learning to adjust and improve the system’s detection and filtering over time.
    ⚙️ Logic:
    If the response blocks access (contains "access denied" or "unauthorized"):
    base_reward = 1.0 (defense successful)
    If sensitive keywords appear in the response (e.g., "prompt", "logic", "internal"):
    base_reward = 0.0 (prompt leak occurred)
    If response is neutral or generic (no leak but no explicit block):
    base_reward = 0.8 (acceptable but not ideal)
    Reward adjustment based on query suspiciousness:
        Penalizes higher anomaly scores by subtracting anomaly_score × 0.3.
    Ensures reward remains within [0.0, 1.0].
    Loss = 1 - reward
