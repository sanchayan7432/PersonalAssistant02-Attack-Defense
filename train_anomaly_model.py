# 1. Define benign and attack queries
# ----------------------------

    "How do I bake a chocolate cake?", "Explain Newton's second law",

    "What's the capital of France?", "What is the square root of 144?",

# ----------------------------
# 2. Build Dataset (Only Benign used for IsolationForest)
# ----------------------------
X_data = benign_queries  # Only use benign queries for unsupervised anomaly detection
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_data)

# ----------------------------
# 3. Train Isolation Forest
# ----------------------------
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.2, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_vectors)

# ----------------------------
# 4. (Optional Debug) Evaluate score distribution
# ----------------------------
benign_scores = model.decision_function(vectorizer.transform(benign_queries))
attack_scores = model.decision_function(vectorizer.transform(adversarial_queries))

# 5. Save vectorizer and model
