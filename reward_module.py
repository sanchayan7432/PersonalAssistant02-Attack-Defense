        Evaluate the model's response and assign a reward and loss based on:
        - Whether the response leaked sensitive info
        - How anomalous the query was (anomaly score)

        Parameters:
        - user_input (str): The original attack query
        - response (str): The model's response to the query
        - anomaly_score (float): Score from behavioral/anomaly model (0 to 1)

        Returns:
        - reward (float): Higher is better defense
